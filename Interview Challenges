my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 100, 110, 21, 33, 32, 2, 4]
listAsString = ''.join(map(str,my_list))                             <”.join()> method joins all the elements into one and returns it as a string
print(listAsString)



4) How to convert a list into a tuple?

weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
listasTuple = tuple(weekdays)                              #tuples are immutable i.e. unchangeable so we cant add or takeaway from these elements 
print(listasTuple)



5) How to convert a list into a set?
# method 1 
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
set = set(sample_list)
# method 2
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
sample_set = set()                    # defining an empty set          
for i in sample_list:                 # loop through sample list with temp variable 
    sample_set.add(i)                 # emptysetname.add(tempvariable)
# method 3 
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
t = {x for x in sample_list}              # this is set comprehension - returning a set based on iterating variables 
print(t)
# method 4
a = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
x = list(dict.fromkeys(a))                   #this does not print in an orderly manner 
converted_set = set(x)
print(converted_set)
