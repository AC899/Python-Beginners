2) What is <Yield> Keyword in Python?



3) How to convert a list into a string?

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 100, 110, 21, 33, 32, 2, 4]
listAsString = ''.join(map(str,my_list))                             <”.join()> method joins all the elements into one and returns it as a string
print(listAsString)



4) How to convert a list into a tuple?

weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
listasTuple = tuple(weekdays)                              #tuples are immutable i.e. unchangeable so we cant add or takeaway from these elements 
print(listasTuple)



5) How to convert a list into a set?
# method 1 
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
set = set(sample_list)
# method 2
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
sample_set = set()                    # defining an empty set          
for i in sample_list:                 # loop through sample list with temp variable 
    sample_set.add(i)                 # emptysetname.add(tempvariable)
# method 3 
sample_list = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
t = {x for x in sample_list}              # this is set comprehension - returning a set based on iterating variables 
print(t)
# method 4
a = [1,2,3,'seeker',3,7.5]
x = list(dict.fromkeys(a))                   #this does not print in an orderly manner 
converted_set = set(x)
print(converted_set)




6) How to count the occurrences of a particular element in the list?

weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print(len(weekdays))



7) What is NumPy array?
NumPy arrays are more flexible then lists in Python. By using NumPy arrays reading and writing items is faster and more efficient.

8) How can you create Empty NumPy Array In Python?
We can create Empty NumPy Array in two ways in Python,
import numpy
numpy.array([])



12) What is Enumerate() Function in Python?
#enumerate adds a counter to a loopable object i.e. gives us a way of counting based on the below
subjects = ('Python', 'Interview', 'Questions') 
for i, subject in enumerate(subjects):            #loop temp variable in temp variable in enumerate(object we want to loop through)
    print(i, subject)                            #print the numbers, subject
