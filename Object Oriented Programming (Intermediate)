In the early days of computing most programmes wer estraighfroward but as computers became more powerful - languages and best practices evolved to suit developers. 

This led ato a programming paradigm: a specific way of writing programs with decreased bugs and increased optimisation. 

Object orienttion is the most popular paradigm used today. Imagine a simple to do list which has a desription, status and a list of tasks ....... all programs have data and behaviour and in the case of our to do list
that's the name of tasks and whether they are complet. The  to do list is what apps do with the behaviour. The data and behaviour makes up the core of what the behaviour will do.

The data and the behaviour is grouped toegether in objects (an entity in our code which contains all teh data and attributes in a easy to use cointainer). We access the data through the object. 

Four pillars of object orientation: a) encapsulation: an object's ability to bundle together related data and behaviour to limited scope. 

b) abstraction: the ability to hide complex logic from the user making the code easier to use in other places i.e. when you send an email and click accept (you dont need to now anything about email servers etc.) the info is abstracted. By placing all the complex logic in classes (just like with emails) we are able to extract it awy form people using the code
In reality we may need complex code, logic for updating the value to make sure the current user has permission to toggle it but if we ar e using a task object all we need to do is call the toggle complete method and we get that effect. 

c) inheritance: allows a class to inherit all of the functionality of another class. We don't have to reimplement or rewrite any logic. It is automatically avilable to any of the  code interacting with a task i.e. a deadline task object and 
all be iherited by another class. 

d) polymorphism: having multiple forms. Allows to use different task objects in our programmes interchangably. 

Procedural programming: the order of code matters. Data is mutated as teh program carries out the behaviour. 

Functional programming: the data and behaviour are separate. We never mutuate data directly but instead return new copies of updated data. 



#Example of inheritance (the children are inherting the properties of the parent class (Animal) 

class Animal:                         # Parent class 
  def eat(self):
    print("Nom Nom Nom...eating food!")

class Dog(Animal):                   # Child class with the parent as the parameter 
    def bark(self):
        print('Bark!')

class Cat(Animal):                    # Child class with the parent as the parameter 
    def meow(self):
        print('Meow!')


fluffy = Dog()                    # We are calling the children of the parent class 
zoomie = Cat()                     # We are calling the children of the parent class 
mark=

fluffy.eat()
zoomie.eat()                     # eat is the constructor defined to print the result in the parent class
